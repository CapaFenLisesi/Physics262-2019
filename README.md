## Group Theory for Physicists

[Syllabus](https://github.com/Tanedo/Physics262-2019/blob/master/Syllabus%20P262_%20Group%20Theory.pdf)




### Course Description

Graduate-level introduction to the representation of continuous (Lie) groups and how they appear in quantum mechanical systems. How are continuous symmetries manifested mathematically in our physical theories? What patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking are allowed? How do representations combine? Examples will draw from particle and nuclear physics, but the course will focus on the mathematical formalism relevant to many theoretical disciplines. (Strongly recommended to hep-ex/ph students and cond-mat theory students.)

### Evaluation
3 problem sets (60%)  

1 in-class presentation and essay on an application of group theory in your field (20% + 20%)  

### Pre-requisites
Familiarity with linear algebra at the level of Physics 221 (Quantum Mechanics). No background (or primary interest) in particle physics, field theory, or abstract algebra necessary. 

## About PHYS 262

Physics 262 is a graduate-level special topics course in high-energy physics. Topics change by year and instructor. The course may be taken multiple times for credit. ***Please register for this class***, by registering, you are encouraging the department and the college to offer more of these special topics courses in the future.
