### Course Description

Graduate-level introduction to the representation of continuous (Lie) groups and how they appear in quantum mechanical systems. How are continuous symmetries manifested mathematically in our physical theories? What patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking are allowed? How do representations combine? Examples will draw from particle and nuclear physics, but the course will focus on the mathematical formalism relevant to many theoretical disciplines. (Strongly recommended to hep-ex/ph students and cond-mat theory students.)

### Evaluation
3 problem sets (60%)  

1 in-class presentation and essay on an application of group theory in your field (20% + 20%)  

### Pre-requisites
Familiarity with linear algebra at the level of Physics 221 (Quantum Mechanics). No background (or primary interest) in particle physics, field theory, or abstract algebra necessary. 

## About PHYS 262

Physics 262 is a graduate-level special topics course in high-energy physics. Topics change by year and instructor. The course may be taken multiple times for credit. ***Please register for this class***, by registering, you are encouraging the department and the college to offer more of these special topics courses in the future.



### Tentative course plan

We'll see how things actually pan out as the course goes along.

Week 2: fundamental, anti-fundamental, adjoint: what is a representation (chapter 1-2)
Week 3: roots and weights (chapter 6)
Week 4: generalization to SU(3) (chapter 7)
Week 5: simple roots (chapter 8 - 9)
Week 6: tensor and irreducible representations, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (chapter 10)
Week 7: Dynkin diagrams  (chapter 6)
Week 8: spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics
Week 9: presentations
Week 10: advanced topics: the Poincare group and fermions
